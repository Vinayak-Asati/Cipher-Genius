# Yates Fisher Algorithm
Yates' Fisher algorithm is a statistical method used to randomly shuffle the data in a 2x2 contingency table for hypothesis testing. It's a non-parametric test to assess the association between two categorical variables. The process involves permuting the data and calculating a test statistic multiple times to create a null distribution for comparison with the observed statistic. This helps determine if the association between the variables is significant or due to chance.
